# HPC-security-help

This repository accompanies the HPC Security and Getting Help talk that is offered by SDSC and delivered through XSEDE, SDSC's COMPLECS project and other venues. HPC systems are shared resources, therefore all users must be aware of the complexity of working in a shared environment and the implications associated with resource management and security. This module also addresses two essential and related sets of skills that should be a part of everyoneâ€™s toolbox, but that are frequently overlooked: (1) solving problems on your own leveraging online resources and (2) how to best work with the help desk or user support by properly collecting the information that can be used to help resolve your problem.
